# Clustering Movies by Synopsis🎬  

This repository contains a study on **clustering movies based solely on their synopses**, comparing the results with the official genres of the films. The goal is to verify whether the synopses carry enough information to group the films coherently with the assigned genres.

## 📂 Content

All the work development is available in the file **`main.ipynb`**, including:
- Pre-processing of the synopses
- Extraction of textual features
- Application of clustering algorithms
- Comparison of the results with the official genres
